# Battlepass FAQ

# How many missions do I get per day?
Every day you get two new dailies. Once a week, you gain three new weeklies. All seasonals are unlocked from the beginning, with new ones appearing midseason.

# How many missions are there?
There are over 100+ different mission types, from exploring the realm to crafting. The system is designed to reward you passively while playing, but also provide direction if you're looking for something to focus on.

# What if I don't like a mission?
You will need to wait for it to expire, but there is no negative impact. Or, you can reroll the quest 
- Daily Quest Reroll Cost: 1000 Gold
- Weekly Quest Reroll Cost: 5000 Gold

If you really dont feel like completing missions, Consider purchasing Battle Pass Tier Unlocker.

# If I progress through the normal pass, and then buy the premium pass, do I get the rewards?
Yes! You can grab the premium pass at any time, and it will unlock all rewards up to your normal progression.

# How do I access the battle pass?
The battle pass is available from the nexus. Follow the red arrows until you reach a Grove area. There is an NPC woman which opens the pass.

# How long is a season?
Seasons currently last three months.

# Is the battlepass P2W?
It is not. The premium portion of the Battle Pass does not contain any game-loot or game currency. It contains pets, item reskiners, upgraded backpacks, and exclusive unlocks. The only slightly game-related perk is mirrored alerts, but we feel is fair given the ability to trade unlockers.

# Why should I progress the battle pass? Do I have to?!?
No pressure. Don't feel pigeon-holed. If being told what to do isn't your thing, you can completely ignore it with no penalty. Missions? Those aren't for you, and that's ok. For the rest of us? Pick it up at any time throughout the season and gain tangible in-game rewards.

The design behind the normal rewards is to allow small but useful tidbits of progression, as well as tangible rewards for actual character/account progression such as the Lost Scripture's and pieces.

# Are there any exclusive battle pass items?

The majority of the premium pass contents are exclusive to that season.

In terms of normal rewards, the rank 100 rewards are generally exclusive.

With regards to loot, the following items/item redeemers are available from the pass:

    Alert Token (Redeems for one alert.)
    Trial Tokens (Low, Medium, High variants)
    Loot Crates (Redeemable for random chance at multiple crates, all crates supported.)
    Battle Pass Crates. (Redeemable for rewards, such as Insignias, Scriptures & Super Scriptures)
