# Q: How do I get gold fast?

### A: Participate in raids, farm realm event bosses and oryx, and farm mad labs if you are desperte you can farm illsuions though this is signfacinclty harder then the rest. Raids grant a bunch of chances at legendary and even ancient relic items, along with gold cache and coin drops. Realm events can also drop gold caches, as well as legendary and ancient relic items (That drop from Larry Gigsman and Yazanahar). If you want to get rich quick, you can also purchase items and gold from other players using IRL currency. This action is called real-world-trading, or RWT for short.

# Q: What's the best beginner class to play?

### A: It's probably best to play a ranged class such as huntress or even wizard as you start out, so that you have a fair amount of range to let you snipe bosses from a distance while figuring out their phases and attack patterns. But if you're looking for the best, most inexpensive dps character, then blademaster is likely a good option for you. Having access to very cheap powerful gear early on with high dps capabilities.

# Q: How much is {Item}?

# Q: Does dealing dmg increase drop rate?

### A: No, Dealing damge beyond soulbound only helps keep/get you in the AR thereshold For more infomation see bellow

# Q: How do I get ARs (ancient relics)? Is there an AR threshold?

### A: While nobody knows for sure and the details are kept under wraps by the developer team, players have reached the conclusion that Ancient Relics typically drop for top damagers. So if you're in a small group of maybe around 5 to 10 people, all of the people in the group get a chance at an ancient relic. In big groups, only a small number of the big group actually get a chance at dropping an AR. This theory has yet to be disproven.

# Q: How is Wis Mod calculated for the item pages?

### A: When listing the WisMod for abilities, I create a class of whatever the ability is for, ascending and maxing to 24/24. I then drop any robe, wand, and ring equipped, having only the item being checked on in question.
