# Crafting

## Understanding Crafting

In Valor, you can use the Forge in the Nexus in a variety of ways. You can use it to craft legendary items, edit items, upgrade items, activate aspects, and other things. The Forge can[](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1107378591026655272/1111189004713472020/ezgif.com-crop_4.png) be found in the Nexus right below the Public Challenges area and is a big part of obtaining high-tier loot in Valor.

# Currency 

Within Valor there are many different types of currency and each play different roles within the server.

## Fame

![BF](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/1000%20Fame)

Fame is not as commonly used as most of the other currencies, that does not mean it is useless. You can earn fame by dying on characters, which may be one reason it is not used as much; Valor players never die! If you do happen to magically obtain Fame though, you can do the following:

    Make purchases from the Nexus Fame Shops

    Change your In-Game Name

    Create a Guild

    Buying Housing materials

## Gold

![Gold](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/100000%20Gold)

Gold may be the most used currency in Valor in contrary, as it is used when buying items or services from other players and for other in-game mechanics such as [Saturns Orbit](https://wiki.valorserver.com/docs/items/rings/ar/saturns_orbit). You can earn gold buy selling items on the marketplace or for pure gold, Gold Caches, or crushing vials. Getting rich should be your goal, so once you do, you can do the following:

    Buying Items off the Marketplace as well as Removing your own Listings

    Buying Gold Coins from the Nexus Shop

    Opening Scavenger Chests for 500 Gold

    Buying Dungeon Keys from the Guild Hall

    Shining Legendary Items

    Crafting Aspect Enfuser

    Buying Housing Materials

## Onrane

![yoo](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Onrane)

Onrane is a very important currency in Valor as well, being used forge legendary items as well as make your character stronger. Onrane can be obtained as a drop from bosses as well as lootboxes, crushing vials and opening Onrane caches. Once you gain a decent amount of Onrane and feel like spending, you can use it on the following:

    Opening Elite Boxes

    Buying Legendary Items from Shops

    Ascend Sor Crystals

    Consumed when Crafting with Essence of the Realm

    Used for Putting Marks and Nodes on your Character

## Sor Fragments

![SF](https://i.imgur.com/CphVnGK.png)

Sor Fragments are similar to fame in their use, however you earn Sor Fragments significantly more passively, and having a benefit you gain more from than fame. It can be earned as drops from almost all bosses, lootboxes, as well as just buying them off the market. If you have a lot you can do the following: 

    Forge Sor Crystals

    Sor Reactor Passive

## Kantos

![Kantos](https://i.imgur.com/lz7wOUG.png)

Kantos are the only premium currency in Valor, and do not worry they are not pay-to-win. Benefits can be earned from purchasing them with money, buying donator ranks, winning competitions and supporting the server with videos and streams. If you got them, you can use them on the following:

    Buying Cosmetic Pets

    Buying Skins and Skin Effects

    Enabling Server-Wide boosts [Loot Boost and Shine Cost Decrease]

    Item Renamers

    Buying Housing Materials

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Custom Stats" label="Custom Stats">

# Custom Stats

Valor has 10 new stats, 4 of which are maxable with potions while the other 6 only boostable with items. These stats have unique stat caps on each character and are required to max in addition to vanilla stats.

## Luck

![Luck](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Potion%20Of%20Luck)

Luck raises your critical hit chance--not your loot boost. Every 10 luck gives you an extra 1% chance to hit a critical hit.

## Might

![Might](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Potion%20Of%20Might)

Might effects the critical hit damage multiplier. Every 7 might increases your serverside crit multiplier by 0.1x. (Every 76 Might is 1x)

    0 ≤ x < 76 = 1x crits 
    76 ≤ x < 152 = 2x crits
    152 ≤ x < 228 = 3x crits
    228 ≤ x < 304 = 4x crits
    304 ≤ x < 380 = 5x crits 
.

## Restoration

![Res](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Potion%20Of%20Restoration)

Restoration increases the amount of HP and MP you restore by using consumables and potions. It additionally increases the amount of potions you get upon entering the nexus up to a cap of 4 HP Potions and 4 MP Potions that restore 290.

## Protection

![Prot](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Potion%20Of%20Protection)

Protection determines the amount of PT in the White Bar below your MP. The rate is approximately every +1 Prot ~ + 3 PT.

## Life Steal & Mana Leech

![LMSL](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Fused%20Ring)

Life Steal and Mana Leech apply their respective trait onto your weapon. Every 1 of each stat will cause you to restore that amount of HP/MP on a successful hit of an enemy, including Invulnerable ones, while excluding Invincible ones. If you have 5 Life Steal, every time you hit an enemy you will restore 5 HP, etc. This also works on some abilities, including Quivers and Spells, but not AoE ones.

## Fortune

![Luckybaby](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Jackpot)

Fortune is a very strong stat which can aid you when you are grinding. Every 1 fortune boosts your Loot Boost by 1% if that item is equipped. Loot Boost is only tracked the moment an enemy dies meaning you only need to equip your Fortune gear right before an enemy dies, so keep that DPS or Tanky gear on!

## Healing Boost & Mana Boost

![Splitworld](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Robe%20of%20Split%20Worlds)

The least commonly seen stat, Healing Boost and Mana Healing Boost increases your regen from select sources. Healing Boost increases regen from tome heals and the healing buff, whilst Mana Healing Boost increases the amount you regen from Templar's Empowered Buff.

  <TabItem value="Guilds" label="Guilds">

# Guilds

Guilds are expanded upon in Valor, now having a Rank and XP system to reward active and successful guilds with beneficial rewards.

## Guild XP & Rank

![wowifon](https://i.imgur.com/9btEeSe.png)

Guilds gain EXP by having members play the game, once a guild recieves enough EXP it will increase by 1 rank, unlocking perks for every guild member. You can check your Guild's EXP and Rank by using the '/ginfo' command in-game.

# Guild Rewards

You can claim your monthly guild rewards using /ginfo rewards

## Guild Perks

    Rank 1: 25% Better Chance at getting an alert from mobs.

    Rank 2: +10% Loot Boost (Equivalent of +10 fortune)

    Rank 3: Using Essence of the Realm is 25% cheaper and improves loot from Pack Rat Bags.

    Rank 4: Removing nodes from characters is free instead of costing 5 onrane. Guild Hall gains access to a key shop.

    Rank 5: Unlocks the Aspect of Terradius for every guild member.

***You maintain your previous rewards when your Guild ranks up.***

# Trials

![Trial Icon](https://i.imgur.com/zyOu61C.png)  

Trials are a unique mechanic to Valor, allowing you to fight Unique Bosses with accumulated Trial Tokens. Each boss has a unique loot table. In order to enter a Trial, you need Trial Tokens which can be obtained by doing your daily Trial Contracts obtained with '/daily' and from the Battle Pass. From Daily Trial Contracts you gain +10 trial tokens + 2 (per living LS#1 Character) + 3 (per living LS#2 Character) per Contract hand-in. Unlike alerts you can summon others to your trial via partys.

**The Trial Bosses are listed below:**
