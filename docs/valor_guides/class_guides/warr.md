# Basic Overview

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/208327237-b61f2774-90bb-47ed-94ab-47048cee963d.png)


The Warrior is a heavy armor sword class that uses helmets to mainly buff himself or support his allies. The Warrior has stayed as a fun and viable class since his addition, being able to easily provide a lot of DPS to any situation, though lacking high range.

# Swords

**Swords are short range weapons with generally high dmg**


![dblade](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c90692d08e593345f69dd8cd423552ece38669c9d0f52379273c2f10d55a39c8/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f626c6164652532306f66253230746865253230756e646572776f726c64)

Just looking at the stats you should be able to tell why this sword is so often used; It provides some of the highest dps of LG swords at a decent true range, It is also very affordable due to it being an essence craft.


![nem](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a95804b4a0c0828f824f97c0c944ed6bc8b620335e7fe8178888a29ea2aed155/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f756e646561642532306e656d65736973)

While mediocre at first sight The Undead Nemesis is a surprisingly viable sword with DPS similar to Underworld and with a straight shot pattern this sword is a very good option. It also Provides the BIS Speed of any sword


![jewl](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d2aa4f9d72be48f4f4c80d34d5319c3cb11152a3739d5a71b4c8487c20f6a0c3/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6b4a454f4a456c2e706e67)![shal](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff05bcf721c46e39f13b8e35a7a9045b53920a79eb56ca4065a24faeb5368221/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f51456f6f6367382e706e67)

While not normally used in actual combat Bejewled Spear and Shaylee are great for their fortune +4 and +2 respectively. It is not advised to main these swords instead switch to them before the boss dies to gain the fortune.


![slash](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d6c2fd21f61cea5eb35b98fe1af545aa1d8441316983b47d47e726674ef3c11a/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f6d616c69676e616e74253230736c6173686572)

The pinnacle of LG swords, the slasher provides great DPS at a large 6.6 range, Do note that slashers large damage range makes its DPS less consistent compared to other swords. The only downside is its price tag compared to other swords.


![axe](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aaa8e970e7e4b5955af5af105a09da6f6748f0156ee877b5806d8f65007da09a/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f7761726178652532306f662532306a756467656d656e74)

The Waraxe is a sitting sword similar to that of pixie from prod, Its DPS is the highest of all lg swords surpassing even non enchanted clranet. Take caution when using or you will get a swift death **THIS SHOULD NEVER BE YOUR ONLY SWORD.**


![ar](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e6792501788b1be3088d01fd6a57fe8ea4c171a8258a3c27e9ae3f779bb5ba25/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f436c6172656e74)

What is there really to say it's the AR sword of course it's going to be great; You have staggering high dps at a serviceable 4 range. Like slasher the only real downside is how rare and costly this item is

     Air For constinet dps


     Fire for critical damage


     Water for longer range


     Earth for a massive hp pool


![garg](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6348ede5d78b9c35acd5fe3caa5a3268957d6accfd7c513a3b369f04f4bae56/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f676172676f796c6525323063727573686572)

Unimpressive DPS wise this sword shines with its potential burst dmg and hefty **+100% HP** doubling the warriors already high hp, It's also won't hurt your gold stack costing around the 70k mark due to being decently common drop from a heavily ran dungeon.


![gem](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dfe08ae90b548b1ab06826e23c522f4e9d152424184cb8fa9c36ad32048c5114/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f67656d25323073776f7264)

Not much to say about this sword, it's an upgraded crystal sword sacrificing a good amount of DPS for a range of 6.6. If you don't have a slasher and need range this is the sword for you however if you have slasher this sword gets completely obsolete.


![oath](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3b1ae2d781184d8e2c12b41caf6759534107c4289b8fd8035d6c18d670397bce/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f6f6174682532306f6625323074686525323061676573)

Unimpressive DPS and range wise this sword only deserves a mention for its 40 Wisdom, If you want to make a support style warrior using burden of warpawn this is the sword for you with Stoneplate it can let you keep stun up permanently, If you are using dark retribution you be better served by any of the other options


![claw](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c74b1150c3f2b2acb4cd9c5dc4cb8212835cf177035ae512a466d5cba79f44ba/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f737069726974636c6177)

With stats similar to that of Undead Nem this sword's saving grace is its weaken for 0.4 seconds on hit, This allows the warrior to assist the group and his own survivability while sacrificing some DPS. Overall a Great choice.


![boneaxe](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/acd8c12ea8e986b31abbaccb96ebc21b988f8ea5f4196b8680c40aec3af24fc6/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f626f6e65253230617865)


If you are on a tight budget the Bone Axe works very well for what it is, It's outclassed by most lg swords so only use it if you can't afford the other options.


# Helmets

**Most helmets provide berserk at a 1 second downtime.**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/208326905-24ec42dd-d0df-427f-aa7e-5396be1ff4c5.png)

Anguish of Drannol is the best DPS helm before erebus and allows for permanent berserk; Its on equip stats are some of the best of any helm with its **+4** Life Steal and 100 HP. If you can't afford erebus or want more survivability this is the helm for you.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/208326986-8dd094fd-92b5-4499-9499-9b3c3964a8b3.png)

Fortune helm. There's really not much more to say about this helm it's a tiered helm with fortune on equip, Equip it before a boss dies.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/208327042-d0b52be2-8411-468a-a6ac-bee118aca543.png)

Due to a recent buff this item is now the best rushing helm due to giving swiftness for 4 seconds, Besides that this helm has no other use.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/208327094-8e6e2bcc-84bf-4bf3-b525-25a3eedc0124.png)


Tyrant's helm, A tiered helm with a max hp buff for the duration of the berserk. Decent if you want more survivability.


![dark](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6e6275982d9aba5055f573f13b2790545f4a4fdf571f2fbb49010b1fca9387ea/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f68656c6d2532306f662532306461726b2532307265747269627574696f6e) ![burden](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7ccce423f04f70b32d4f99bd37a3ef8ebd4996dddafd1b5f3ce78359a28add02/68747470733a2f2f7677696b692e76616c6f727365727665722e636f6d2f6170692f6974656d2f706963747572652f62757264656e2532306f662532307468652532307761727061776e)


Odd Choices at first glance these 2 helms do have a use, And that is turning warrior into a support class.

  - The Helm of dark retribution is generally better for healing due to its lack of a cooldown and high heal.

  - Burden was originally a very bad helm but a recent buff has made it far more usable. Burden is more useful if you can deal with the cooldown and with enough wisdom you could be able to perma buff it's stun.

Erebus is the current best helm for DPS and General use giving bravery and berserk with a 1 second downtime, And gives a whooping **10%** crit chance on equip. However it is a very rare drop from O3 making it pricey to buy and hard to farm.


# Heavy Armors

**Heavy Armors Generally have high defense while lacking other stats**


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/200111544-092afe09-6b92-4dcc-a022-341128aa9f68.png)![Righteous](https://i.imgur.com/gARczWe.png)

The Odyssey and Plate of Righteous Fury Are the main DPS armors you'll be using, providing large amounts of luck and might. The Odyssey has slightly more DPS then Fury but loses out on Furys massive 150 HP Bonus. While Fury has a large HP boost the Warriors already high HP makes it slightly less appealing then Odyssey. Overall if you want DPS these are great and won't break the bank.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/200111950-f0705f3c-ceff-46ba-ad3d-a4e794fa6700.png)

The V-L Spark Armor is an interesting choice not being subpared in really any aspect besides its +8 Fortune boost. You'll mainly want to swap to this item before the boss dies to utilize the fortune bonus. It is also the only Heavy Armour besides AR Helldom Earth to give life steal. While not excelling in any stat it is a tolerable main armor if you want the life steal or fortune.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/200112014-2bf60865-ec04-4754-a6c8-dfef1eb1f640.png)


One of the more useless armors, Stoneplate gives no dps meaning its only viable use is on a Support Warr running Burden of the Warpawn.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114798136/200112083-67b6e208-a09d-43bc-98fd-0568d11b8ebd.png)


The Helldom is extremely powerful, offering high DPS stats on equip and large survivability. The only downside of using Helldom is its extreme rarity with a measly 18 total drops Losing it makes it almost **unrecoverable**. While most would rather use this armor on Knight, The Warrior is still a very good choice for it.
