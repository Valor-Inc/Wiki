# 2FA

Two-Factor authentication, (or 2FA, for short) strengthens login security by requiring a second piece of information — a second factor beyond your password. The second piece of information is usually a temporary code delivered by a device in your possession, such as your phone. It may also be something on your body, such as a fingerprint.

## How do I set-up 2FA?

Step 1 - Install a 2FA app--the apps recommended by Valor Staff are Google Auth or Authy.

Step 2 - Link your discord account, then run '/2fa' followed by '/2fa confirm' in-game

Step 3 - Scan the Code that will be DM'd to you by the Valor Bot into your Authenticator app, or enter the provided code manually. 

***If entering manually, Valor uses timer 2fa.***

Step 4 -  When logging in, use the code provided by your Authenticator app, and enter in the "Auth Code" section.

## 2FA Rewards

Every once in a while, Valor Staff will offer special cosmetic items, or similar such things to all users with 2FA enabled. So you lose nothing but gain tons of security!
