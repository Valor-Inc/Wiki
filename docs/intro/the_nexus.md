# Welcome to the Nexus

**Welcome to the Nexus; a safe haven from your Valorous quests as well as valuable resources. The Nexus can be quite confusing to beginners as the layout is unique and there is custom content ready to great beginning players!**

Below is a map of the Nexus, and as you can see there is many locations of interest! We'll go over them so you won't be confused, dont worry!

# The Ascension Enclave

![Ascension](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1022980193406693436/unknown.png)

**The Ascension Enclave is the place to be for when Raid Tokens are activated, as that is where the portal for the Raid will spawn. There are no requirements for entrance to the Ascension Enclave. It can be accessed via the '/enclave' or by visiting the portal on the far-right side of the Nexus.**

![Ascensionint](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1022983178857742376/unknown.png)

The layout of the Ascension Enclave is very simple, as it's purpose is only to connect players with Raids. However, if you do want a private location for hitting training dummies, this and the Guild Hall make exceptional choices!

# The Aspect Hall

![Aspect](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1022984808411971635/unknown.png)

The Aspect Hall holds all of a players [Aspects](https://wiki-test.valorserver.com/docs/items/misc/aspects). You can only use one aspect at a time so make your choice wisely. Not all aspects are items that drop from bosses, so a full list of all aspects can be found **[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15PVh8JpINav9iNmGch8VHajk90lFQvk3Sb1eXzxf3LE/edit)**.

![AspectHInt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1022987240177156126/unknown.png)

You will start with the three Aspects shown, and as you unlock more, the golden squares will be replaced. Aspects are very powerful resources that can change the capabilities of your character passively and actively!

The Battlepass is some of Valor's newest content, and has players complete in-game missions for Battlepass XP.

  <TabItem value="Housing" label="Housing">

# Housing

Valor is home to Housing, a system that lets players create houses to hang out in or access certain tiles & placable objects.

## The Home Depot

The Home Depot is where most housing content can be bought or accessed, with a few others coming as rewards from the battle pass. It is located at all the green wizards in the nexus.

![HomeDepot](https://i.imgur.com/7C1O4Ti.png)

Items in the will cost either Gold, Fame, Kantos, or Onrane and you can upgrade your max housing size with gold or kantos via the green allow in the top left of the menu shop.

## House Editing

The Housing Editor can be found on the main menu at the bottom right of your characters screen.

![HouseEditorButton](https://i.imgur.com/loQV6ZE.png)  

Clicking it will open the editor where you can place the tiles & objects you have on your account in any configuration you want (as long as you have a spawn location) and then Save(Submit) it to the server for you or anyone else to visit later.

## Visiting Houses

The command `/vhome [playername]` can be ran ingame to visit their housing, this works for your own house as well. Anybody can do this at any time, even if the owner is offline or elsewhere in Valor.

![HiShad](https://i.imgur.com/DPZEf5b.png)

## Functionality
  
The main draws of housing are for creating art, showing off your wealth with an expensive house, having somewhere private for popping keys or what have you, or for using private target dummies to test your damage or other effects.

# Loot Boxes

![LBL](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1023007770825461850/unknown.png)

Valor has various types of lootboxes; do not worry they all except one are obtained by playing. Each of these lootboxes have different item pools and drop locations, but they can all be checked from the same location: the top left of your screen whilst in the nexus or vault. On the Lootboxes Page, you can find Gold, Silver and Bronze Lootboxes, as well as your collected PackRat bags. Gold, Silver and Bronze lootboxes drop in the Realm, while Packrat bags can be found while doing ascended dungeons.

# Untiered Lootboxes

![ebox](https://i.imgur.com/3jSgUE4.png) ![scav](https://i.imgur.com/TNozVGl.png) ![Prem](https://i.imgur.com/UsXv5zh.png)

In the Untiered Lootboxes tab, we can find Elite Boxes, Scavenger Chests and Premium Loot Boxes. Elite Boxes are obtained by defeating Raid Boxes and Public Challenges, while Scavenger Chests are earned by completing Daily contracts. Premium Loot Boxes are the only box that can not be earned in-game and instead must be purchased for [Kantos](https://valorserver.com/ranks).

# Marketplace

![Marketp](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1023009863724449792/unknown.png)

The Marketplace is an incredibly important part of Valor, and acts as the location to buy and sell items for gold. Not all players are allowed to use the Marketplace, as Elite Accounts are not allowed to buy or sell items from other non-elite account players, thus they aren't allowed to use the market. All transactions on the marketplace have an 8% Tax put onto the seller of an item. It also costs 50 gold to remove an item if it isn't your most recently placed item.

![Marketint](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1023013544410746920/unknown.png)

You can access the Marketplace GUI by talking to the Human NPCs within the marketplace. In this GUI you can sort every item currently on the market, see all the items you have listed on the market, and you can even buy items directly from the GUI instead of waiting for it to be sorted in!
